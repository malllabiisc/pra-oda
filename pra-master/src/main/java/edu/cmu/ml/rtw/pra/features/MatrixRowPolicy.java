 * Determines which rows are acceptable to keep when computing feature matrices.  Primarily used in
 * PathFollowerCompanion, but I made it separate so that it's more easily referenceable and
 * reusable if things change later.
 *
 * Note that this policy does not affect the memory usage of the algorithm; we still keep all
 * observed rows in memory until the matrix is asked for, at which point we filter it before
 * returning it.  It might be worth it to change this someday, to check for whether a row is
 * acceptable before aggregating counts.  It would save some memory at the cost of increased
 * processing time while doing the walks.  Currently, that's not really an issue, however, so we
 * don't do it.
